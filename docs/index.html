      <p>
        Millenia ago, there was a man. He awoke, unexpectantly, from an ancient
        slumber. His first words in this mysterious world in which he
        materialized: "Hello, World!" (he was quite the optimist). His name was
        John Language. And the first thing he did was create the world's first
        programming language: John Language. The second thing he did was create
        the Midwest.
      </p>

      <p>
        As optimistic as he was, the great John Language was not the inventive
        type (he would not invent creativity for another thousand years!); he's
        a simple man. Thus, John Language is not the most interesting
        languageâ€”quite mundane even. But, as John Language would tell you,
        "It'll get ya where you need to go!" Another common saying of John's
        was, "There's no stopping that neck once it gets going." Archaeologists,
        however, have yet to uncover what he meant by this.
