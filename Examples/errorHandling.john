But dontcha know, I told her, \"Whoa, whoa, whoa. I can fix 'er!\" Cause, ya know, all those mechanics will charge ya DOUBLE what it's gonna cost ya to fix it on yer own. And so I went down to the hardware store, but wouldn't ya know it, they were closed! So I turned around and went to my parents house (they don't get out much, eh? Ye know all this weather; they just weren't built for it, cause they moved up from down south in Florida, cause that's where my dad worked. Ya know, he moved there when he was forty years old, but by then the kids were outta the house and he and my mum had no problem setting down roots again. But they wanted to be closer to family after he retired so they came back up here to Wayzata, but, eh, wouldn't ya know it, they were used to all that warm weather down there in Florida!). And, just as luck would have it, my pops had a spare muffler in his garage (he was quite the handyman back in his day dontcha know), and he invited me in for a cawfee (you know we always take our cawfee black, eh), and we got to chit-chattin' about the kiddos, and it was real nice. But I had to get going, so I grabbed that muffler, drove on back home (the snow was comin' down like cats and dogs at that point), and fixed up ol' bessie's muffler in a jiffy."!
